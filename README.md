# Underwater Laser Design
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
## Requirements
1. Laser MUST be tested to 150 fsw for 90 minutes over 10+ dives (30 fsw/min on ascent and descent) in both on and off conditions.
2. Laser MUST have a user replaceable rechargeable battery (either AA rechargeable NiMH/NiCd or 18650 Li-Ion).
3. Laser MUST be ANSI/IEC Class 3R and maximize laser power output within regulatory limits.
4. Laser beam SHOULD be aligned to within 0.1 degree (6 MOA).
5. Laser assembly SHOULD include a calibration stage (both as a procedure and physical assembly).
6. Total laser BOM (including machine time and labor at U.S. market rate for batch qty 100) SHOULD be less than USD 150.
