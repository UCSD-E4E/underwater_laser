# Underwater Laser Design
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
## Requirements
1. Laser MUST be tested to 150 fsw for 90 minutes over 10+ dives (30 fsw/min on ascent and descent) in both on and off conditions.
2. Laser MUST have a user replaceable rechargeable battery (either AA rechargeable NiMH/NiCd or 18650 Li-Ion).
3. Laser MUST be ANSI/IEC Class 3R and maximize laser power output within regulatory limits.
4. Laser beam SHOULD be aligned to within 0.1 degree (6 MOA).
5. Laser assembly SHOULD include a calibration stage (both as a procedure and physical assembly).
6. Total laser BOM (including machine time and labor at U.S. market rate for batch qty 100) SHOULD be less than USD 150.
7. Laser MAY utilize COTS components or be a COTS component.

# Underwater Laser Mount
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
## Requirements
1. Mount MUST be robust to 75 lb crushing forces from any direction.
2. Mount MUST mate to a standard cold shoe.
3. Mount MUST resist 50 lb forces from any direction once mounted to the cold shoe with at most 0.1 in deviation.
4. Mount MUST resist 25 lb-ft torque from the laser mouning interface once mounted to the cold shoe with at most 0.5 degree deviation.
5. Mount design MUST define dynamic rules to fit an arbitrary cylindrical laser up to 2.1 in diameter.
6. Mount MUST provide visual or mechanical indexing to locate the cylindrical laser to within 1 degree of rotation.
7. Mount MUST be built from corrosion resistant materials, and provide for galvanic corrosion prevention over the operational lifetime.
8. Total mount BOM (not including laser, including machine time and labor at U.S. market rate for batch qty 100) SHOULD be less than USD 150.
9. Mount MUST be between +1 and -1 lbs of buoyancy in seawater.
10. Mount MUST have an operational lifetime of 100 dives or 3 years.
